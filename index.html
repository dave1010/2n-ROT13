<h1>2<sup>n</sup>-ROT13 encoder / decoder</h1>

	<h2>About 2<sup>n</sup>-ROT13</h2>

	<p>ROT13 is an awesome algorithm. It's a special version of the Caesar cipher, that can be <em>enhanced</em> by using multiple rounds. It's well battle-tested as it's been around for many years.</p> 

	<p>Security experts currently recommend using <em>bcrypt</em>, <em>scrypt</em> or <em>PBKDF2</em> for storing passwords. These methiods use multiple rounds of simple algorithms such as SHA1 and Blowfish. The algorithms themselves are cracked very simply but using multiple rounds makes brute-forcing much harder.</p>

	<p>In the same way, ROT13 can be applied multiple times to make it harder to brute force. Here's an important looking <a href="http://phoenix.clifford.at/~ak/2rot13.pdf">scientific paper</a> (it's a PDF, so it must be reliable), explaining the benefits of applying just 2 rounds of ROT13 (2-ROT13). One of these benefits is that 2-ROT13 has never been brute-forced.</p>

	<p>My old favourite encryption method was bcrypt, which applies 2<sup>n</sup> rounds to the Blowfish cipher. I've taken the best bits of bcrypt (the 2<sup>n</sup> rounds) and the best bits of 2-ROT13 (the strength against brute-force) to create <strong>2<sup>n</sup>-ROT13</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Encoder / Decoder bookmarklet</h2>

	<p>Everyone loves bookmarklets. This bookmarklet uses my 2<sup>n</sup>-ROT13 method do encrypt all the text on any web page (it even works on inline stylesheets). If the page is already encrypted then it will automatically decrypt it.
	</p>
	
	<p><blink>Drag this bookmarklet to your bookmarks toolbar, go to any website then click on it:</blink> 
		<a href="javascript:(function(){(function(){var%20g=document.createElement('script');g.type='text/javascript';g.src='http://2nrot13.createopen.com/bookmarklet.js?'+Math.random();var%20s=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);})();})();" onclick="alert('You should drag this to your bookmarks toolbar.\n\nLets run it now anyway')">2^n-ROT13</a>

	<h2>Paste text</h2>
	<p>Paste text here and it will automatically be encrypted or decrypted:</p>
	<textarea>Mary had a little lamb,
whose fleece was white as snow.

And everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.</textarea>

	<h2>The Code</h2>

	<p>An implementation of 2<sup>n</sup>-ROT13 (and this whole site) is available on <a href="https://github.com/dave1010/2n-ROT13">Github</a>, just for you to play with.</p>

	<h2>The Future</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>REST API, with JSON and XML - please get in contact if you would be interested in this service</li>
		<li>Get number of rounds from random.org for &gt; 100% secuity</li>
		<li>I18n</li>
		<li>Port to node.js</li>
		<li>Host this site over HTTPS (even though current HTTPS encryption isn't as strong as 2<sup>n</sup>-ROT13)</li>
	</ul>
